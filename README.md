# Counterparty credit risk under credit risk contagion using time-homogeneous phase-type distribution

This git repo contains two piece of information 

This thesis plan to build on reduced-form credit risk models to assess the credit risk contagion
that is inherent in a obligor multivariate framework. The aim is to evaluate the requirements that
are necessary in generating a mathematical framework consistent with the valuation of nancial
claims, credit and non-credit related, where the parties of those claims exhibit credit risk contagion.
By applying a multivariate framework of credit contagion to counterparty credit risk based on
a queueing theory, called phase-type distribution, we hope to highlight the benet of bottom-up
models versus top-down ones in terms of extracting information relative to dependence within an
identiable obligor set. We will review the mathematical literature in addressing credit dependence
modelling in dynamic and static format. This will be the opportunity to value a set of claims under
our model to show that claims that contain \credit leverage"are particularly sensible to credit risk
contagion and could benet from our developed framework to gain adequate counterparty credit
risk pricing.
